Lab 08- Textures

This program reads in two different images, and applies them to objects in the scene as textures.

To use this program, you use the number keys 0-9 to change the shape that is located in the screen. Of interest are #5, the teapot, and 0, the quad.  It is currently set to use the Mines Logo as the texture, with the quad repeating in the s and t directions. To set to brick, find TODO #3, and change the glBind call to brickTex, instead of texHandle.

This should compile with whatever make you use from the makefile.

There are no known bugs in this program as of now.


Questions:
1. The teapot now has the brick texture applied to all surfaces.

2. The other objects are not textured.

3. The quad now has the brick texture on it.

4. The Teapot now has the Mines logo, repeated several times.

5. The Mines logo is on the quad once, and is oriented correctly to the camera.

6. There are now 4 Mines logos on the quad.
